If 3D volume rendering using ray casting is slow, you can use nearest neighbor interpolation when you're adjusting the rendering settings, and switch to linear interpolation for the final rendering.
You can switch the interpolation type used by slices view by right-clicking on the picture.
If 3D volume rendering is slow, use texture mapping or 3D texture mapping for speed, then ray casting for the final image.
You can toggle logarithmic scaling of channel histograms by right-clicking on the histogram.
If 3D volume rendering is slow, click on the volume rendering in the rendering module list to activate the controls, then move the rendering quality slider towards the left. This computes fewer rays for a lower resolution image in ray casting, or in texture mapping renders fewer transparent planes on your graphics card.
You should report any problems you have to bugs@bioimagexd.org
If 3D volume rendering is slow and your data set is very large, you can resample it to a smaller size to get better interactive speed in 3D volume rendering

You can use the Control-key to select or de-select multiple datasets in the file tree. You can use shift to select all from a selected item to the one you are selecting in a single data set or file.
You can resample datasets to a smaller size if you do not have enough memory to open them. Resampled datasets are marked with red color and an asterisk (*) in the file tree.
When starting to work with the animator, you need to interact with the 3D rendering preview box to enable it.
To visualize multiple channels, you can use the Merge tool that combines the channels into one RGBA volume.
